This project uses mainly `python` in version 3.
The easiest way to have every required libraries is to use a virtual
environment:

* Install `virtualenv` if necessary.
* Set up a virtual environment: `virtualenv -p python env` (replace `python`
with `python3` if `python 3` is not your default `python` version).
* Activate it: `source env/bin/activate`.
* Install the required libraries using `pip`:
	`pip install -r requirements.txt`
* If you do not need to tweak anything, simply run the application:
  `python run.py`
